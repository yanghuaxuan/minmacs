* MinMacs: My second Emacs config
Since I've been using Doom Emacs, my first Emacs config is very messy and no longer reflects my current workflow, I've decided to make another Emacs config!

With Emacs 29, a good chunk of "core" Emacs plugins have actually became part of Emacs (use-package, tree-sitter, eglot), therefore, I've decided to revisit making my own Emacs configuration, using as little external packages as possible.

Emacs >= 29 Required!
